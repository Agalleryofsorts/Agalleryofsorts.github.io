            <p>This is my very first webpage! I am so excited to be learning
            from my very good friend Tyler Domerese. He has alot to do 
            with why I am pursuing a career in Coding. This will be a journey
            into building something inspiring and modern I have seen through
            coding. The visual appeals,the simple layouts, the awesome graphics.
            Well, let's get started!
